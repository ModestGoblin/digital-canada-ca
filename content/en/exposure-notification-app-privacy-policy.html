            <h2 class="section--title">Your privacy is protected</h2>

            <p>Strong privacy protection has been built into the COVID Alert app.</p>

            <p>It is extremely unlikely that you will be identified while using this app. The COVID Alert app takes extensive steps, described below, to ensure your privacy and data are protected.</p>

            <h2>What the app collects and stores on your phone</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Random codes from your phone, for 14 days</li>
                <li>Random codes from other phones near you, for 14 days</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The random codes are only stored and used for the purpose of notifying you, or others of possible COVID-19 exposure.</p>

            <h2>How the data is protected</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>The app cannot connect your identity with the random codes.</li>
                <li>Your phone encrypts the random codes. You must give your permission before your phone will share the
                    random codes with COVID Alert.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>COVID Alert has no way of knowing or sharing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Your location</li>
                <li>Your name or address</li>
                <li>Your phone’s contacts</li>
                <li>Your health information</li>
            </ul>

            <hr>


                <h2 class="section--title">What the app shares</h2>

                <h2>Nothing is done without your permission</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nothing is shared without your explicit permission.</li>
                    <li>When you give permission, the only information that’s shared is the random codes from your phone.</li>
                    <li>Only the app and its server will have access to the random codes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>If you’re diagnosed with COVID-19</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can choose to share your random codes from the past 14 days with a central server.</li>
                    <li>If you share your random codes, nobody will get any information about you or the time you were
                        near them.</li>
                    <li>You’ll also be asked for permission to share your random codes with a central server for 13 days after.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>If a person you were near reports a diagnosis through the app</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>No information about you is shared with anyone.</li>
                    <li>You will not receive any information about anyone else, including the identity of anyone who was infected with whom you may have come into contact.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <h2 class="section--title">Deleting your data</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>All random codes, whether from your phone or others, are deleted after 15 days.</li>
                    <li>You can delete the app at any time, and the random codes on your phone will be automatically
                        deleted.</li>
                    <li>If you uploaded your random codes before deleting the app, they will be deleted from the server after 15 days.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <h2 class="section--title">Other information about you</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Your health information stays with your provincial or territorial healthcare provider. COVID Alert does not know who you are and does not have access to your health information.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The 8-digit number provided by your healthcare provider tells COVID Alert that you can upload your random codes.</li>
                        <li>COVID Alert trusts this number. The app uses this number so it does not have to collect any personal information that could identify you.</li>
                        <li>Healthcare workers have no way to provide your personal information to COVID Alert.</li>
                        <li>In order to protect the integrity of the 8-digit numbers provided by your healthcare provider, your province may generate a long internal identification number assuring that the 8-digit number was generated by a valid source. The Government of Canada is not able to associate these internal identification numbers to you or other app users, and they are only used when needed to prevent cybersecurity threats.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <hr>
                <h2 class="section--title">Your IP address</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>As a security measure, if you enter an incorrect 8-digit number, the app will store your IP address for five minutes. The app does this to protect against bad actors. </li>
                    <li>Without these security protections in place, spammers could flood the COVID Alert system and your phone with fake exposure notifications.</li>
                    <li>Your IP address is never connected to any other information about you, and it’s only used to ensure the integrity of the system.</li>
                </ul>
