            <p>The Canadian Digital Service (CDS) is building an Exposure Notification app to help stop the spread of COVID-19 in Canada. </p>
            <p>This app is now in its Beta phase and we need your help to test it.</p>
            <p>Beta phase means the software is built, but we need people (like you!) to test the app and ensure itâ€™s working smoothly. </p>
            <p>If you live in Canada, are over the age of 18, and would like to participate in this research, please continue reading. </p>
            <p>No expertise about COVID-19 is needed.</p>
